            <p>Trotters is a mobile app whose purpose is to help connect people who share interests when traveling. For instance, meeting Jazz Fusion enthusiasts when visiting Japan!</p>
            <p>It has been developed by Jorge Rodrigo Leclercq, individually and without profit.</p>
            
            <p>The frontend is programmed with React Native and the backend with Node.js, which is hosted in an AWS Elastic Beanstalk server and uses MongoDB as a database.</p>
        
            <h2>Use of Google OAuth</h2>
            <p>Trotters uses Google's OAuth to authenticate users securely when signing in. The only information accessed is the userâ€™s email, which is used solely for authentication purposes and is not shared with third parties.</p>
            <p>This authentication method ensures a secure and seamless login experience while protecting user data.</p>
            
            <p>The app is available for Android devices.</p>
